Phantom,American Pit Bull Terrier,Canis familiaris,"He will eat shoes if given the chance, so shoes should be kept in the rack inside the hall closet by the front door.|If his leg is giving him trouble, he can have 1/2 of a Carprofen every 12 hours.|Phantom is allowed to free-roam while the house is empty, but the hallway gate MUST be closed before leaving the house.|The freezer is stocked with frozen feeder toys. Give one to him as needed if he is bored or needs a distraction.|The cardboard piled on top of his crate are used to make enrichment boxes. Sprinkle a few treats in a box, tape it up, and give it to him when he's on his placemat.|He is free to sleep wherever he wants to at night.|He handles thunderstorms pretty well, but in case he gets visibly worked up, he can have 1/2 of a Trazodone.|One of his favorite games is playing 'Find it!' using the little pill bottles that smell like essential oil. Just ask him to wait on his placemat, hide the pill bottles around the house, and then tell him to 'Find it!'. Make sure to reward him with treats for each bottle he successfully sniffs out.",mammal
